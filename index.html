       <p>Hello, my name is Matt St.Clair. I am an Air Force veteran and a mental health therapist, transitioning into the web development field. I am finishing a B.S. in computer applications development from Renton Technical College while also taking full stack web development courses at Codefellows code camp in Seattle. I enjoy front end as well as back end work but am especially fascinated with UX design and how it blends with my social sciences background. I also enjoy front-end work because it allows me to collaborate and create with clients. </p>
